## Hi there 👋, I'm d0nut

🧑‍🎓 I'm currently a student at ISET'COM Tunisia passionate about **Cybersecurity**, **Robotics** and **Development**.

⚙️ Love building robots and competing in tech challenges, my main focus right now are line following competitions.

**🚧 My previous projects:**
- Developed an automated system to generate SOC reports using a combination of a data analysis script and Sysreptor.
- Developed a mobile app called “Quarny” that displays a Quran verse based on the emotion you select. 


**🔧 Tech I Work With:**
- Languages: Python, Dart, C/C++ (Arduino)
- Embedded: ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi
- Networking: CCNA 1, 2 & 3, TCP/UDP, VLANs, VPN's

**🚀 What I’m Working On:**
Developing an integrated digital access and payment system that uses ESP32 and Raspberry Pi for device control, QR code recognition for identity verification, and a mobile app to streamline my university’s cafeteria workflow.

⚡ I’m naturally curious and always eager to learn new things. I pick up skills quickly, and I love understanding how things work so I can build whatever I imagine.
